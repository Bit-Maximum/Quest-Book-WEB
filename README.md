## 🗺 About

Despite its small scale, I aimed to make the landing page as expressive and engaging as possible — featuring the ambiance of an ancient civilization, interactive elements, and responsive layout design.

The project consists of **two pages**:
- The main landing page
- A demo fragment of the book with interactive elements
